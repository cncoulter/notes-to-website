# Markdown

[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a good general-purpose introduction to Markdown.

This notes system uses [Pandoc](./pandoc.html) to convert Markdown to HTML, so you should refer to [Pandoc's Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) to see what exact syntax is supported.
