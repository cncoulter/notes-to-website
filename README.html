    <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
    <p>This instructions work on <a
    href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> and should work on
    other GNU/Linux distros. If you run a different operating system,
    your setup process may differ.</p>
    <h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>Install <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> and <a
    href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.</p>
    <p>On Fedora, you can install these programs by running the follow
    command in your terminal:</p>
    <pre><code>$ sudo dnf install pandoc git</code></pre>
    <h3 id="basic-setup">Basic Setup</h3>
    <p>Clone or download this repository to your desktop.</p>
    <p>Each category folder has a build.sh file. This file is a Bash
    script that when executed will covert the Markdown files in that
    folder to HTML files.</p>
    <p>The build scripts will not work until you update them. You only
    need to update line 5 in the build.sh files; set it to the path for
    the notes folder. For example, if your username is cam, if you have
    your notes saved in your Nextcloud folder, and if your notes folder
    is named “notes-to-website”, then line 5 should look like:</p>
    <pre><code>rootDir=/home/cam/Nextcloud/notes-to-website</code></pre>
    <p>You will need to update every build.sh file accordingly.</p>
    <p>To run the build scripts, execute the script in your terminal,
    like so. Make sure your terminal window is in the same folder as the
    build script.</p>
    <pre><code>$ ./build.sh</code></pre>
    <p>If you lack permission to run the build files, you can use the
    <code>chmod</code> command to give yourself permission to run the
    file:</p>
    <pre><code>$ chmod u+x ./build.sh</code></pre>
    <p>If you only made changes to notes within one sub-folder, you only
    need to run the build script for that folder. If you want to update
    all of your notes at once, you can run the build-all.sh script. Like
    with the build.sh files, you will need to update line 5 in
    build-all.sh before you can successfully run it.</p>
    <p>That is all the setup that is required. Now you can edit the
    existing notes and run the build scripts to covert your notes to a
    simple website.</p>
    <h3 id="sync-your-files">Sync Your Files</h3>
    <p>This notes system is simply a folder with plain text and HTML
    files inside. If you want your notes to be available across your
    devices, then you can sync the notes folder using Dropbox,
    Nextcloud, Syncthing, or whichever file syncing service you
    prefer.</p>
    <h3 id="customize-styles">Customize Styles</h3>
    <p>The css folder has styles.css, a stylesheet for your notes
    website. This stylesheet is derived from the styles on <a
    href="https://www.camcoulter.com/">my personal website/blog</a> and
    will switch between light/dark modes depending on your preferences
    saved in your browser.</p>
    <p>All of the webpages reference this stylesheet, so if you make a
    change here, all of your webpages will update accordingly, without
    you needing to build them again.</p>
    <p>If you want to try customizing how your notes website looks, try
    this:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>In the css folder, delete the styles.css file.</li>
    <li>Find and download a <a
    href="https://dev.to/logrocket/comparing-classless-css-frameworks-3267">classless
    CSS stylesheet</a> that you like. I am a fan of <a
    href="https://watercss.kognise.dev/">Water.css</a>.</li>
    <li>Put the classless CSS stylesheet in the css folder, and rename
    it to “styles.css”.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="customize-template">Customize Template</h3>
    <p>The template.html file serves as a template for the webpages. You
    can edit this file if you want to change the header or add a
    footer.</p>
    <p>If you sync your notes folder to your mobile devices, there is a
    chance the styles won’t display properly on mobile because mobile
    operating systems are weird. One way to fix this would be to update
    the template.html file so that it directly includes your CSS styles
    as an <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/How_CSS_is_structured#internal_stylesheet">internal
    stylesheet</a> rather than an externally referenced stylesheet.</p>
    <p>Any time you make a change to template.html, you will need to
    re-build your notes website to see the changes take effect.</p>
    <h2 id="ongoing-usage">Ongoing Usage</h2>
    <h3 id="build">Build a website from your notes</h3>
    <p>Once you have made a change your notes in Markdown, you will need
    to run the build scripts to update your notes website.</p>
    <p>If you only updated notes in one category folder, you can just
    execute the build script in that folder. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>$ ./Lists/build.sh</code></pre>
    <p>You can also run the build-all script, which will update your
    entire notes website, making sure it mirrors your Markdown
    notes.</p>
    <pre><code>$ ./build-all.sh</code></pre>
    <h3 id="add-page">Add a new page</h3>
    <p>To add a new page, first create a plain text file with the
    extension -.md. Do not include spaces within filenames.</p>
    <p>The start of your new notes page should look something like
    this:</p>
    <pre><code>---
title: To Read
---
# To Read</code></pre>
    <p>The title value will serve as the webpage’s title. (That’s the
    text you see identifying the tab in your browser.) The text after
    the number sign will serve as the primary heading for the new
    page.</p>
    <p>You likely want to edit an existing note so that it links to your
    new note. The simplest way to do this is to open the index.md file
    for the same category, and add a link there to the new note.</p>
    <h3 id="add-category">Add a new category</h3>
    <p>To add a new category, make a new folder. It should not be nested
    within an existing category folder.</p>
    <p>Create a index.md note for the category within the new folder,
    and edit the primary index.md note so that it links to the index for
    the new category.</p>
    <p>Copy the build.sh file from an existing category folder, and
    paste it into your new category folder. Update line 6 so that it
    references the new category folder.</p>
    <h3 id="link-to-page">Link to another page</h3>
    <p>Here is the standard Markdown syntax for a link:
    <code>[Cam's personal site](https://www.camcoulter.com)</code>. That
    will appear as <a href="https://www.camcoulter.com">Cam’s personal
    site</a> when converted to HTML.</p>
    <p>If you want to link to another file in the same folder, structure
    your link like so: <code>[My Notes Homepage](./index.html)</code>.
    That will appear as <a href="./index.html">My Notes Homepage</a>
    when converted to HTML.</p>
    <p>If you are editing the primary index note to link to a note in a
    category folder, you will need to include the category’s folder name
    within the link, like so:
    <code>[To Read](./Lists/to-read.html)</code>. That will appear as <a
    href="./Lists/to-read.html">To Read</a> when converted to HTML.</p>
    <p>If you are editing a note within a category to link to a note in
    a different category, structure your link like so:
    <code>[Pandoc](../Tech/pandoc.html)</code>. That is how you would
    link a note in your Todo folder to a note in your Tech folder.</p>
    <p>Essentially, whatever the filename of the Markdown note is, the
    filename of the HTML note will be the same, except with the
    extension changed accordingly. You don’t need to include
    <code>https://www.</code> within the link when you are linking to
    other pages on the same site. When you are linking to other pages on
    the same site, <code>./</code> indicates that a file is available in
    the current/same folder, and <code>../</code> indicates that a file
    is available the parent folder.</p>
    <h3 id="version-control-git">Version control with Git</h3>
    <p>You can use Git to version control your notes. Review <a
    href="./Tech/git.html">your notes on Git</a> for guidance on how it
    works.</p>
    <p>You can make commits every time you edit a note, or you can just
    commit a routine monthly snapshot if that works better for you.</p>
